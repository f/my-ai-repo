## Introduction

My AI Package is a collection of tools and utilities to help with various machine learning tasks. The package features a string padding function, which allows for custom padding of strings from the left or the right using a specified character.

Not only does this function enable the manual adjustment of string length, but it also preserves the original string content. This can be useful in various situations including filling or alignment of text within a specified field.

## Features

- String Padding: Pads strings with a character from the left or the right.
 - Customizable Length: Extends strings to a desired length without modifying the core content.
 - Easy Integration: Integrates easily into existing projects and applications.

## Installation

We recommend using NXn to install the package: 

```bash
npm install my-ai-package
```

## Usage

Simply import the package and use the padding function:

```jscript
const padString = require('mappad');
return padString("sample text", 10, '-', 'left');
```
